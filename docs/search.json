This is because there are no methods to\nanalyse them comprehensively, especially as the molecules, which are\ncreated during combustion, react with each other and with other\nmolecules in the environment to produce a huge variety of molecules,\nmany of which are very large macromolecules. Because it is difficult to\nfollow the molecules and their reactions in the environment, the\nfraction of particles that can be analysed becomes smaller and smaller\nwith time and as they age. This makes it difficult to detect them with\ncontemporary methods. The objective of this project is to develop\nmethods to analyse aerosol particles which cannot currently be\nanalysed.\nThe idea behind this project is a method that stems from polymer\nchemistry and will allow to look into particles like polymers, more\nbroadly known as microplastics - thereby a broad spectrum of aerosols\ncan be analysed. The method we plan to develop will hopefully allow to\nbetter analyse many such large molecules.\nResearch motivation\nThe interest in the project is not just of scientific nature but also\nbecause of the possible influence on climate and health. I.e. Aerosol\nparticles can be the seed for clouds which reflect sunlight and have a\ncooling influence. Other types of particles are quite dark so they\nabsorb sunlight and heat up the atmosphere a bit more, especially when\nthey are deposited on a lighter surface like on the Arctic’s snow and\nice where they can increase the absorption. The project’s focus is\ntherefore on the cryosphere such as the Arctic and Alps where bright\nsurfaces like snow and ice are prevalent.\nResearch impact\nThe direct impact of this method is that new chemical tracers (found\nin the environment) will be used as chemical fingerprints which can be\ntraced back to predecessor molecules and their specific sources. This\nallows to identify the origins of pollutants which are potentially\nharmful for health and climate. I.e. the analysis of macromolecules\nallows to trace them back to their original source. An example would be\nwood combustion, i.e. the burning of wood results in large molecules,\nwhich could then be traced back to wood combustion. This method could\nthen be used in all kinds of samples, like ice cores or sediments, which\nmay lead to information like historical changes in global fire\nbehaviour, linked to changes of human behaviours, which affect health as\nwell as the climate.\nThis\ntext is an adaptation of a portrait about the project, originally\npublished as as a “News & Highlights” item on the Energy and\nEnvironment (ENE) division website at PSI.
