## Research Interest  
I am interested in short-lived climate pollutants, their sources, effects on climate, health impacts, and potential mitigation pathways. This includes not only combustion products, but also other light absorbing aerosols and impurities in snow and ice; like algae, bacteria, dust, soot, or polymers. In short: macromolecules
